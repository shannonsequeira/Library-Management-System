# Library Management System

Welcome to the **Library Management System** repository! This project uses Streamlit to build an interactive web application for managing library books. Designed to be user-driven, the application features a graphical user interface (GUI) to streamline book management tasks such as adding, updating, deleting, searching, and borrowing books.

## Key Features

- **Add Book**: Add new books to the system with details such as title, author, ISBN, and cover image URL.
- **Update Book**: Update existing book details using ISBN.
- **Delete Book**: Remove books from the system using ISBN.
- **Search Books**: Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Borrow Book**: Mark books as borrowed.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Google Books API for book data
- **Python Libraries**: `requests`, `Pillow` for image handling

## Prerequisites
